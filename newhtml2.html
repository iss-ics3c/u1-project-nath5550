        <div> you will be builing CPUs from scrach under a microscorp from bit slice technology from clusters of other CPUs around both shared and switching fabrics, as well as hardware peripheral devices to perform various functions that made the  CPUs useful and you will have mapped display boards aswell as  disk controllers with memory systems

            It shaped how you will need to  think about code you will need to know where it all lives and how it work junction physics.

Not that you will not be uesing abstraction heavily Just that there's no until you get to the actual quantum chemistry of the silicon of the highest order</div>
